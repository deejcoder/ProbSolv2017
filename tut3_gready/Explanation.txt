Aim: maximize the sum of Worth seen on each defending card.

Suppose we have a defending card (where all defending cards are ordered by Worth, as number one priority), and try to find an attacking card that can be beaten by this card.

Two cases:
1. There is no card (~a) that this defending card can beat (d) therefore the defending card should
	knock out the highest attacking card.
2. There is a card (a) that this defending card can beat (d) therefore the defending card lives,
	and knocks out the highest possible attacking card that it can.


The number of high attacking cards that are being knocked out is maximized.
If that is so and if the highest Worth defending cards are compared first, the Worth is therefore maximized. However if a card of high Worth has low ability, should we not want to waste a card that
is of low ability to maximize Worth?

This suggests that if there exists a high Worth card that is knocked down, but there also exists
a card of low Worth and low ability, then the Worth is not maximized.

However the greedy method still offers a decent solution.
